                <h1>The Battle of Crossbarry</h1>
                <p>
                    On March 19, 1921, the Third West Cork Flying Column of the IRA, under the command of the legendary Commandant General Tom Barry, achieved an extremely significant victory at Crossbarry, situated about twelve miles south-west of Cork city.
                    A huge encircling operation involving over 1,000 British troops and 120 Auxiliaries was mounted in an attempt to finally eliminate this troublesome column, which at that time was operating at a  total strength of 104 men. Although vastly outnumbered, Tom Barry took the calculated risk of engaging in a stand-up fight with the enemy. At the end of the battle there were at least thirty-nine British soldiers (including five officers) dead and forty-seven wounded, as against three IRA men dead and two wounded.

                    As a result of the information they had got from a volunteer captured at the Upton ambush in February, 1921, the British military were aware that the West Cork Brigade headquarters was situated in the Ballymurphy area.
                    The British devised a plan to surround the Ballymurphy townland area using troops from Bandon, Cork, Ballincollig, Kinsale and Macroom. The troops were to be transported to within four miles of the area where half of the troops would dismount and advance on foot in a line towards Ballymurphy. Every house in the area would be raided all adult males arrested. The soldiers on foot were to interchange periodically with those in the lorries, thus ensuring fresh troops throughout the operation.

                <p>
                    Commandant General Tom Barry was awakened at 2.30 a.m. and told that the sound and lights of lorries were to be heard and seen in the distance. He immediately organised his men. 'I had to decide without delay whether to fight or to retire and attempt to evade action.' It wasn't an easy decision, because any section could be caught while retiring, possibly with heavy casualties as a consequence. Furthermore, the shortage of ammunition, demanding a swift and intensive fight at close quarters, was a major problem. He quickly decided they would stand and fight together.</p>
                <p>
                    Fearing encirclement by the enemy, he spoke to the column indicating 'that we would first smash one side of the en­circlement on the Crossbarry road, and then deal with the others; above all no man or section was to retire from their posi­tion, and all were assured that they would be quickly reinforced if and when attacked.</p>
                <p>
                    Barry had to plan and plan quickly. His attack had to be decisive and delivered in such a way as to break the encirclement. The one hundred and four IRA men were divided into six sections in the form of a triangle, with section seven at the other side of the road (later moving into position to form a square). Communica­tion between Barry as Column Commander and the other officers and the various sections was to be maintained by runners. The command post was movable between the centre sections.</p>
